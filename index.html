The theme park's cast members speak Cantonese, English and Mandarin. Guide maps are printed in traditional and simplified Chinese as well as English.

        The park has a daily capacity of 34,000 visitors[3] — the lowest of all Disneyland parks. The park attracted 5.2 million visitors in its first year, below its target of 5.6 million. Visitor numbers fell 20% in the second year to 4 million,[4] inciting criticisms from local legislators.[5] However, the park attendance jumped by 8% in the third year, attracting a total of 4.5 million visitors in 2007. In 2009, the park attendance again increased by 2% to 4.8 million visitors. The attendance continued to surge and received 5.23 million guests in the 2009/2010 fiscal year. Since the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland, the theme park has hosted over 25 million guests.[6] According to AECOM and TEA, Hong Kong Disneyland is the 13th most visited theme park in the world in 2013, with 7.4 million visitors.</p>

        <p>Taking place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, The Lion King tells the story of Simba (Swahili for lion), a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's paternal uncle Scar kills Mufasa to seize the throne, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile. After growing up in the company of the carefree outcasts Timon and Pumbaa, Simba receives valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.

          The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, to critical acclaim, praising the film for its music, story, themes, and animation. With an initial worldwide gross of $763 million, it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing film of 1994 and the second-highest-grossing film of all time, behind Jurassic Park (1993).[5] It also held the title of the highest-grossing animated film, until it was overtaken by Finding Nemo (2003). The film is still the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time, as well as the best-selling film on home video, having sold over 55 million copies worldwide. It received two Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.</p>

        <p>This animated film is truly the Citizen Kane of contemporary cinema. This is the type of film that I would love to experience again and again. It has comical quips for the youngsters and it has a few hee hee haw haws for the more experienced cinema lovers. Hearing Alec Baldwin’s voice come out of a baby will never cease to be funny. The first film was a good start to the franchise known as Boss Baby. I have yet to experience Boss Baby: Back In Business but I will be sure to watch it after returning to my humble abode. Now back to Boss Baby 2: Family Business. The animation was top notch. Dream Works continues to put out quality visual beauty. The voice cast all clearly had a lot of fun voicing the numerous characters, you really feel a familial bond between the characters. The environments feel so real and yet so cartoony at the same time. The school has such a unique chaotic attitude. The Boss Baby still makes funny yuk yuk ha ha jokes that will go over kids heads. The visual humor is funny too. I laughed out loud several times in the theater. The music was great and fit the tone flawlessly. Overall a harmless charming film about family that I will soon experience again.</p>

        <p>Queen Elsa begins to hear a mysterious melodic voice calling to her. Unsettled, she answers it, thus awakening the elemental spirits and setting into motion a quest to restore an old injustice.King Agnarr of Arendelle tells his daughters Elsa and Anna that their grandfather, King Runeard, forged a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in the Enchanted Forest (their homeland). A fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the forest's classical elements of earth, fire, water, and air. The elements disappear, and a wall of mist traps everyone in the forest; Agnarr barely escapes, helped by an unknown savior.

          Three years after her coronation,[b] Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, the snowman Olaf, the iceman Kristoff, and Kristoff's reindeer Sven. One night, Elsa hears a mysterious voice calling her. She follows it, unintentionally awakening the elemental spirits and forcing everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. The Rock Troll colony arrives, and Grand Pabbie tells them that Elsa and the others must set things right by uncovering the truth about the past. Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven follow the mysterious voice, and travel to the Enchanted Forest. The mist parts at Elsa's touch, while the air spirit appears as a tornado, catching everyone in its vortex before Elsa stops it by forming ice sculptures. She and Anna discover that the sculptures are images from their father's past, and encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers that it is an agitated magical salamander and calms it. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr (an Arendellian). They later learn about a fifth spirit, who will unite the people with the magic of nature.</p>
